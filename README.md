# Flowdock

Ruby Gem for using the Flowdock Push API. See [Push API documentation](http://www.flowdock.com/api/push) for details.

## Build Status

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/flowdock/flowdock-api.png)](http://travis-ci.org/flowdock/flowdock-api)

flowdock gem is tested on Ruby 1.9.3 and JRuby.

## Dependencies

* HTTParty
* MultiJson

## Installing

    gem install flowdock

If you're using JRuby, you'll also need to install jruby-openssl gem.

## Usage

To post content to Chat or Team Inbox using `Flowdock::Flow`, you need to use the target flow's API token.

Alternatively you can use your personal api token and the `Flowdock::Client`.

All tokens can be found in [tokens page](https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens).

### REST API

To create an api client you need your personal [api token](https://flowdock.com/account/tokens), an [OAuth token](https://www.flowdock.com/api/authentication) or a [flow_token tied to a source](https://www.flowdock.com/api/sources).

Note that a source `flow_token` will only allow you to post [thread messages](https://www.flowdock.com/api/production-integrations#/post-inbox) to the flow the source belongs to.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'flowdock'



# Create a client that uses you api token to authenticate
api_token_client = Flowdock::Client.new(api_token: '__MY_PERSONAL_API_TOKEN__')

# Create a client that uses you api token to authenticate

flow_token_client = Flowdock::Client.new(flow_token: '__FLOW_TOKEN__')
```

#### Posting to Chat

To send a chat message or comment, you can use the client.chat_message:

```ruby
flow_id = 'acdcabbacd0123456789'

# Send a simple chat message
client.chat_message(flow: flow_id, content: "I'm sending a message!", tags: ['foo', 'bar'])

# Send a comment to message 1234
client.chat_message(flow: flow_id, content: "Now I'm commenting!", message: 1234)
```

Both methods return the created message as a hash.

#### Post a threaded messages

You can post `activity` and `discussion` events to a [threaded conversation](https://www.flowdock.com/api/integration-getting-started) in Flowdock.

```
client.post_to_thread(
    event: "activity",
    author: {
        name: "anttipitkanen",
        avatar: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946511?v=2",
    },
    title: "activity title",
    external_thread_id: "your-id-here",
    thread: {
        title: "this is required if you provide a thread field at all",
        body: "<p>some html content</p>",
        external_url: "https://example.com/issue/123",
        status: {
            color: "green",
            value: "open"
            }
        }
    }
}
```


#### Arbitary api access

You can use the client to access api in other ways too. See [REST API documentation](http://www.flowdock.com/api/rest) for all the resources.

```ruby

# Fetch all my flows
flows = client.get('/flows')

# Update a flow's name
client.put('/flows/acme/my_flow', name: 'Your flow')

# Delete a message
client.delete('/flows/acme/my_flow/messages/12345')

# Create an invitation
client.post('/flows/acme/my_flow/invitations', email: 'user@example.com', message: "I'm inviting you to our flow using api.")

```

### Push api

To use the push api, you need a flow token:

#### Posting to Chat

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'flowdock'

# create a new Flow object with target flow's api token and external user name (enough for posting to Chat)
flow = Flowdock::Flow.new(:api_token => "__FLOW_TOKEN__", :external_user_name => "John")

# send message to Chat
flow.push_to_chat(:content => "Hello!", :tags => ["cool", "stuff"])
```

#### Posting to Team Inbox

```ruby
# create a new Flow object with target flow's api token and sender information for Team Inbox posting
flow = Flowdock::Flow.new(:api_token => "__FLOW_TOKEN__",
  :source => "myapp", :from => {:name => "John Doe", :address => "john.doe@example.com"})

# send message to Team Inbox
flow.push_to_team_inbox(:subject => "Greetings from Flowdock API Gem!",
  :content => "<h2>It works!</h2><p>Now you can start developing your awesome application for Flowdock.</p>",
  :tags => ["cool", "stuff"], :link => "http://www.flowdock.com/")
```

#### Posting to multiple flows

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'flowdock'

# create a new Flow object with the api tokens of the target flows
flow = Flowdock::Flow.new(:api_token => ["__FLOW_TOKEN__", "__ANOTHER_FLOW_TOKEN__"], ... )

# see above examples of posting to Chat or Team Inbox
```
